SOURCE CODE:

package Exp_5_5;

public class Employee {
	
	private int id;
	private String name;
	private String dept;
	private double salary;
	
	public Employee(int id, String name, String dept, double salary) {
		super();
		this.id = id;
		this.name = name;
		this.dept = dept;
		this.salary = salary;
	}

	public String getDept() {
		return dept;
	}

	public void setDept(String dept) {
		this.dept = dept;
	}

	public int getId() {
		return id;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setSalary(double salary) {
		this.salary = salary;
	}
